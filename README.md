# gridSystem
Got nostalgic over strategy and tactics RPGs, making a grid system.


The goal of this project is to have entities on a grid, and to be able to move these entities from one grid tile to another.
Want to implement some pathfinding to get from each entity's initial point to it's end point.

The map is currently generated at random as a 5 x 5 grid with random elevations.


CONTROLS:

  -WASD: move cube from tile to tile
  
  -Q/E: pan camera around map
  
  -ScrollWheel: Zoom in/out
