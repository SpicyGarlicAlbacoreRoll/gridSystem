# gridSystem
Got nostalgic over strategy and tactics RPGs, making a grid system.


The goal of this project is to have entities on a grid, and to be able to move these entities from one grid tile to another.
Want to implement some pathfinding to get from each entity's initial point to it's end point. Can currently set unit cube's 
location in grid and with in given circular range.

The map is currently generated at random as a 10x10 grid with random elevations.


CONTROLS:

  -WASD: move selection tile around grid
  
  -Q/E: pan camera around map
  
  -ScrollWheel: Zoom in/out

  -SPACEBAR: Confirm new position (must be tile in red circle)
